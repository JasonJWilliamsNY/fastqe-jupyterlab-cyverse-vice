If the sequence quality is poor, then your resulting downstream analysis will be inaccurate and misleading. FastQC is a popular software used to provide an overview of basic quality metrics for NGS data. In this lesson, you will use an even more universal form of communication to analyze FASTQ files, THE EMOJI 😻😻😻."

    "Like the popular FastQC software, FASTQE can be used to analyze the quality of FASTQ file data whether it’s from a genome sequencing project, an RNA-seq project, a ChIP-seq project, etc. Here’s a brief background on the in class metagenomics project that Dr. Enke’s Bio 481 Genomics class is collecting data for. Garter snakes excrete sexually dimorphic pheromones to attract a mate. The hypothesis of their experiment is that male and female garter snakes host unique microbial communities in their mouths, cloacae and musk glands that contribute to sexually dimorphic bioengineering of these pheromone molecules. Figure 1 provides an overview of their 16S metagenomics analysis pipeline. For this lesson though, all you need are the FASTQ files. Feel free to substitute your own favorite FASTQ files for this activity if you like.  "

Swabs were placed in sterile tubes to release collected microbes & DNA was extracted for downstream analysis (B). Barcoded primers were used to PCR amplify the microbial 16S ribosomal DNA repeat genes for each sample followed by Illumina sequencing of PCR amplicons (C-D). The DNA Subway Purple Line web-based software can be used to analyze FASTQ data files generated from Illumina sequencing to reveal the microbial population of our swabs (E).
